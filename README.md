## Challenge

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent 
  of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## What I learned

This was a good first challenge, it really got me thinking about what wasn't needed in the code or how I could combine classes/ids to optimise the existing code. 

## Installation

No installation required, it is a simple html/css site. 

## Credits

Original code provided by Horiseon, refactored by me. 


## License

I used the MIT Licence for this project.
